Physics Informed Neural Networks To Solve Problems In Solid Mechanics
All the codes in this repository are written based on TensorFlow-gpu 1.14. 
It is recommended that you set up a new environment in conda and install the libraries in that environment.
To run the codes, please install following libraries. TensforFlow-gpu 1.14, numpy, scipy, matplotlib
Each .py file is self-contained and can be run directly.
Please change the paths of the saver objects according to your need. You can also run the codes as it is and it will generate the folders in your running direcotry.
